# Area Finder

This is an app built with React.
To run the app locally, clone the repo
Then from the command line run npm install (This will install all the dependencies)
Finally run the command npm run dev
When this command is run, the app will be hosted on localhost:5173

This takes you to the homepage
From the homepage, type any location into the chat box, suggestions of location will pop up
Select any of the locations you wish to view.
If the location has any reviews, clicking on the location routes you to the reviews that have been recorded for that location.
You can also create a personal review about the place
To create any review, you must select some tags about the location and also type a message into the text box, else you won't be able to add any review.
From anywhere, clicking on the profile picture routes to the user's reviews
That is, a list of all the reviews the particular user has made
To store the list of reviews, I used the localStorage method as I think using a database for this might seem like an overkill
I also didn't use TypeScript because I wanted to make the project as simple as possible
The app has a light and dark mode version
